"""
This submodule contains application level authentication logic.

Authentication for Kollie is primarily handled out of bands at the proxy level
by OAuth2Proxy via nginx-ingress' auth_request configuration. Kollie expects
user information to be made available as request headers for authenticated
requests. When Kollie runs behind nginx + OAuth2Proxy, it expects the following
headers to be present:
    - x-auth-request-user (The federated user_id from Google - not important)
    - x-auth-request-email (The email address of the authenticated user)
    - x-auth-request-groups (Google groups that the user is part of. Comma separated)

Local development:
This submodule contains some developer eargonomics to take the
x-auth-request-email from environment variables to help with local development

NOTE: OAuth2 proxy will be configured differently for API routes compared to
UI routes. For API routes, a token valid token is required in the Authorization
header. UI routes are authenticated by first going through the OAuth login flow
and then maintaining a sticky session. This means standalone UIs should have
OAuth2 proxy put in front of it to obtain a token which is then included in the
header when making calls to the API.
